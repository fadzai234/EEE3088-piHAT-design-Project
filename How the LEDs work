How the LEDs work :
When the temperature is low, the voltage will be between 0-1.3V no light will be emitted, however once the voltage reaches 1.4V the red light will be emitted from the red LED.
The red LED has a forward voltage between 1.4V -1.7V. 
This red light will indicate a low temperature. 
Between 1.8-2.9 V which is the normal operating temperature a green light will be emitted from the green LED. 
Once the maximum temperature of 60Â°C is reached, which corresponds to 3.0V, a blue light will be emitted from the Blue LED which has a forward voltage of between 3.0-3.3V.
