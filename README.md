# EEE3088-piHAT-design-Project
The objective of this project is to design a raspberry piHAT which can sense and log temperatures in environments such as refrigerators and geysers.

The piHAT will be attached to the raspberry pi zero which wil be used to record the temperature measurements which are recieved from a pre-designed temperature sensor board.
