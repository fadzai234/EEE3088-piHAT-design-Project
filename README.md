# EEE3088-piHAT-design-Project
The objective of this project is to design a raspberry piHAT which can sense and log temperatures in environments such as refrigerators and geysers.

The piHAT will be attached to the raspberry pi zero which wil be used to record the temperature measurements which are recieved from a pre-designed temperature sensor board.

The sense microHat will sense and monitor temperature readings. The Hat will be attached to a predesigned sensor that will measure the temperature as a function of voltage and this will be converted to degrees using an analogue to digital convertor. This microHat can be used in a home weather station to measure environmental temperature, in electronic devices or in home automation systems such as a geyser.
